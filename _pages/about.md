# About Me 👋
Hello! I am **Tingjun Huang**, a senior undergraduate majoring in **Information Engineering** at the **Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)**. My passion lies in **robotics** 🤖, where I focus on enabling robots to perceive, navigate, and interact with the real world.

Throughout my academic career, I’ve had the chance to work on exciting research projects. During my time at the **National University of Singapore (NUS)**, I implemented **social navigation in robots** using large language models. Currently, I’m working with Prof. Hong Zhang at SUSTech on **Visual Place Recognition (VPR)** to help mobile robots recognize and navigate their environments more effectively.

I’m also an enthusiastic participant in robotics competitions like **RoboMaster**, where my team consistently ranks high. My expertise spans **deep learning**, **robot navigation**, and **FPGA development**.

# Education 🎓
- **Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)**  
  *Undergraduate in Information Engineering (2021-Present)*  
  **GPA**: 3.92/4.0 (Rank: 1/25)

# Experience 🛠️
- **National University of Singapore (NUS)** – Visiting Scholar (Jun 2024 - Sept 2024)  
  At NUS, I worked on **social navigation for robots** under the supervision of Prof. Lin Shao. I researched and implemented a pipeline for task-oriented social navigation, allowing robots to interact with human environments based on natural language instructions. Key tasks included:
  - Refining an object-navigation repository and resolving technical issues.
  - Developing a social navigation system that enables robots to follow human operators (e.g., doctors) and navigate crowds.
  - Technical Skills: **PyTorch**, **ROS**, **Unity**, **AI Habitat**, **Git**.

# Projects and Research 🚀
